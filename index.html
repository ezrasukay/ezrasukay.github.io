								<b>About:</b> <br>
								Hi, I'm Ezra! I'm studying Astrophysics at JHU in Baltimore, MD. I work with the <a href="https://www.susankassin.com/sliceanddice">Slice and Dice group</a>, lead by Dr. Susan Kassin. I'm using Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy to determine why some galaxies have strong winds, while others do not. 

								I'm also into ice skating and listening to podcasts!

								I use observations to better understand how galaxies change over time. Here's some of the specific projects I have been involved with:
							</p>
							<p>
								I discovered strongly lensed galaxies by searching through public imaging surveys with <a href="https://coollamps.github.io/index.html">COOL-LAMPS</a> while at UChicago. One of those galaxies was <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220311957S/abstract">C00L-J1323+0343</a>, a particularly bright lensed quiescent galaxy at z~1. We characterized its morphology to better understand early-type galaxy evolution and hope to further study CJ1323 with future space based observations! 
							</p>
							<p>
								I used KAST on the Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory to follow up on strongly lensing systems found with a neural network while working with Prof. Xiaosheng Huang and Prof. David Schlegel as a SULI intern at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I also helped create lens models using <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220207663G/abstract">GIGA-Lens</a>.

								The innate wonder people feel when looking up at the night sky and seeing the amazing images astronomers capture with telescopes like JWST make astronomy a great gateway to science! I help out at observation nights at the Maryland Space Grant Observatory at JHU. I have organized and ran observation nights, dark sky camping trips, and talks for the public and students as President of UChicago's Astronomical Society. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I'm also interested in working to making STEM more accessible for those who have been traditionally excluded. At UChicago, as president of our chapter of Out in STEM, I launched new events to help queer students find successful role models & create relaxed environments where we could form community.
